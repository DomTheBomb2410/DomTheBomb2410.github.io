           <article><p>"Jollof rice was probably first cooked during the 14th century in the Wolof empire, which had risen in the previous century in what is now inland Senegal. Rice cultivation thrived in the Wolof empire and formed the basis of many dishes. One of those was thiéboudienne or thiebou dieun, a dish made by cooking rice with fish, shellfish, and vegetables; the word thiéboudienne comes from the Wolof words for rice, ceeb or thiebb, and fish, jën. As the Wolof empire expanded, the dish spread throughout the region, and different ingredients and cooking methods were introduced. Eventually, the new interpretations of thiéboudienne came to be known as jollof, a variant spelling of the dominant Jolof state in the Wolof empire. It should be noted that jollof rice did not replace thiéboudienne, which differs by its necessary ingredient of fish and is sometimes called the “national dish of Senegal.” Some consider jollof rice to be a stripped-down, simplified version of thiéboudienne, which can take much longer to prepare. Others include thiéboudienne under the umbrella of jollof rice."(Britanica Roland Martin)</p></article>
