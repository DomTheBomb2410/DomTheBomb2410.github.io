        <h5 class="text-center">Soccer</h5>
        <p class="text-center">Soccer has always been a major part of my life as I have been playing the sport since I was around 5
          I started playing in the park district then moved to a Academy  and due to covid I had stopped in the Academy.
          I played for my school from 6th to 8th grade.
          The 3 group soccer photos are from our league win where we made a 3-3 comeback on penalties and won(I am the kid with the gray mask in the back).
          The last photo is from a loss in a soccer Conference Game where we were knocked out.
          My main position is Centerback which makes me a defender.

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h5 class="text-center">Volleyball1</h5>
          <p class="text-center">Volleyball has never really been a big part of my life.
            It was one of those sports I did to stay fit during the spring as without it would not be doing anything.
            This group photo taken in our last regular game of the season in 7th grade.

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h5 class="text-center">Basketball</h5>
         <p class="text-center"> I never played basketball a lot even considering my height.
          I had recently started it playing the sport more often during the summer of 2024 which resulted in my joining lane's basketball team.
           I had played for my middle school in 6th and 8th grade as I did not make the team in 7th grade.
           The first basket ball photo is a picture of me in 6th grade after leaving the final in a home loss.
           The second photo is from the lane tech basketball team after coming second in the thanksgiving tournement.
